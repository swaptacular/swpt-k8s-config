This file should contain the SOPS-encrypted "password" for the S3
service. For the testing MinIO server, the password is "console123".
To SOPS-encrypt the password, you may use these commands:

$ echo -n 'YOUR_SECRET_PASSWORD' > spilo-aws-secret-access-key
$ sops encrypt spilo-aws-secret-access-key > spilo-aws-secret-access-key.encrypted
$ shred -z spilo-aws-secret-access-key
$ rm spilo-aws-secret-access-key
