This file should contain the SOPS-encrypted private key for the server
certificate. This private key will be used to authenticate before peer
nodes. See the comment in the "server.crt" file.

To SOPS-encrypt the private key, you may use these commands:

$ sops encrypt server.key > server.key.encrypted
$ shred -z server.key
$ rm server.key
