This file should contain the SOPS-encrypted SSH private key used to
authenticate to the GitOps Git server. To generate a new SSH
private/public key pair, you may use this command:

$ ssh-keygen -f id_rsa -N ''

This will create two files:
1. "id_rsa", containing the unencrypted SSH private key;
2. "id_rsa.pub", containing the SSH public key.

To SOPS-encrypt the "id_rsa" file, you may use these commands:

$ sops encrypt id_rsa > id_rsa.encrypted
$ shred -z id_rsa
$ rm id_rsa
