This file should contain the certificate for the "id_rsa.pub" key
file. To create this certificate, run this command:

$ ssh-keygen -s <path-to-root-ca-private-key-file> -I git-pull -n git id_rsa.pub

Here "<path-to-root-ca-private-key-file>" is the path to your
Swaptacular node's private key, and "id_rsa.pub" contains the public
key generated by the `ssh-keygen -f id_rsa -N ''` command. See the
comment in the "id_rsa.encrypted" file.
