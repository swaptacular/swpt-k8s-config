    # NOTE: Setting connections and requests-per-second limits here is
    # not efficient, because there will be multiple ingrss-server
    # instances, multiplying the limits set here. Also, here we can
    # not set a limit on the number of new TCP connections per second,
    # per IP address, which is what we really need. The solution to
    # this problem is to configure a limit on the number of new TCP
    # connections per IP address either on the load balancer, or even
    # before the load balancer.
