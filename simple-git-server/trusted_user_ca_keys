# To declare your Swaptacular node's self-signed root-CA certificate as
# a trusted certificate, you must first convert the certificate's .crt file
# to a .pub file. To do this:
#
#   1. Extract the public key
#
#   $ openssl x509 -in ~/src/swpt_ca_scripts/root-ca.crt -pubkey -noout > CERT.pub.tmp
#
#   In the above command "~/src/swpt_ca_scripts/root-ca.crt" is the path to
#   the Swaptacular node's self-signed root-CA certificate.
#
#   2. Convert the public key to an SSH format (PKCS8)
#
#   $ ssh-keygen -f CERT.pub.tmp -i -m PKCS8 > CERT.pub
#
#   The above command will generate a "CERT.pub" file, the contents of wihch
#   must be added to this configuration file.
#
# To generate a client certificate, run this command:
#
# $ ssh-keygen -s ~/src/swpt_ca_scripts/private/root-ca.key -I some_id_to_show_in_logs -n git ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
#
# In the above command "~/src/swpt_ca_scripts/private/root-ca.key" is the path
# to the Swaptacular node's root-CA private key, and "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub" is
# the path to a locally generated SSH key (it could also be named "id_ed25519.pub"
# for example). The command will generate a "id_rsa-cert.pub" file in the same
# directory (~/.ssh/ in this example), which will be used by the ssh client
# to authenticate.
